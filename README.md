# 🏺 Vesuvius Challenge – Surface Detection (Ongoing)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Vesuvius Challenge** is a Kaggle-hosted computer vision and deep learning competition focused on digitally unwrapping ancient carbonized scrolls using **3D X-ray CT scan data**. These scrolls are too fragile to be physically opened. The goal is to identify and segment **ink patterns** from volumetric image slices to recover hidden text.

This project focuses on the **Surface Detection** task, which aims to identify the surface layers of the scrolls where ink is likely to exist, enabling downstream ink segmentation and text recovery.
